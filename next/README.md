I did some reasearch in technologies. 

Based on the requirements the application is not very action intensive and is a form application. The gui is not complex at all. The user interacts a bit with the page and leaves (enters some values, doesn't make new http calls). Due to this client side rendering tools Vue, React and Angular are not the best choice. The better choice is to go with server side rendering Nuxt.js, Next.js or Angular universal or even Django. Server side rendering means the there is no need for a seperate back-end server.

Next-
* Very big community
* server side rendering of react code. A lot more strict than normal react(opinionated).
* Is able to do what client side rendering does 
* Has less external packages needed than React
* 

Nuxt- 
* Medium size community
* Does a lot of the same things next does just in vue. Is also opionated.

Angular universal-
* very small community. Also very little documentation.
